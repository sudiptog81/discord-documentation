<h1>Contributing Art for Becca</h1>
<p>
  Becca's <code>art</code> command returns a random image of Becca provided by
  a generous contributor. If you are interested in providing art, please follow
  these instructions!
</p>
<p>
  First, upload the image to Becca's repository. The file should go in the `./img`
  folder. Name your file <code>yourname#.ext</code>, where "yourname" is your
  name or username (no spaces!), # is the number of art pieces you have
  contributed (so if this is your first, use 1), and "ext" is the file
  extension.
</p>
<p>
  Then head to Becca's code and find the file located at
  `./src/utils/commands/artList.ts`. This is where you will add your art to the
  her command. At the bottom of the file, <em>just before</em> the closing
  <code>]</code> symbol, add the following code:
</p>
<pre><code>
{{ '{' }}
  file_name: "The file name from above.",
  artist: "Your name or username.",
  artist_url: "Your homepage link.",
{{ '}' }},
</code></pre>
<p>
  Be sure to replace the values with the correct information. Once this is done,
  you should submit a pull request as documented in
  <a routerLink="/contribute">the contributing instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you have questions, get stuck, or would rather just send the art directly,
  you may contact us at our

  and we will be more than happy to assist!
