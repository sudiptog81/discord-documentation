<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>My bot won't connect!</h2>
<p>
  Make sure you have properly set up the <code>.env</code> file to contain a
  <code>DISCORD_TOKEN</code> variable set to your bot's token.
</p>
<h2>I can't get my bot in my server</h2>
<p>
  Make sure you are generating the invite link correctly, and that you have
  "Manage Server" permissions for the server you are trying to add the bot to.
</p>
<h2>My bot isn't responding to a command!</h2>
<p>
  Make sure your bot has the appropriate permissions in the server. To verify if
  a permission error exists, try granting the bot the Administrator permission.
  If the command starts working, then your permissions are mis-configured.
